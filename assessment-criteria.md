## The Three Legitimacy Dimensions

Each licence type is assessed through three dimensions of legitimacy:

### Credibility

*Is the organisation believed?*

- Track record of delivering on commitments
- Accuracy of public statements
- Alignment between claims and evidence
- Reputation for honesty among stakeholders

**Indicators:**
- Media fact-checking outcomes
- Stakeholder trust survey scores
- History of promises kept vs broken
- Third-party verification of claims

### Consistency

*Does behaviour match stated values?*

- Alignment between words and actions
- Predictable decision-making principles
- Uniform treatment across stakeholders
- Stability of position over time

**Indicators:**
- Gap analysis between stated values and observable behaviour
- Response patterns to similar situations
- Employee/stakeholder perception of "walking the talk"
- Policy-practice alignment audits

### Validity

*Is the organisation's position legitimate?*

- Right to operate in this space
- Appropriate expertise and capability
- Earned position (vs inherited or assumed)
- Accepted by relevant authorities

**Indicators:**
- Formal credentials and approvals
- Recognition by peers and industry bodies
- Community acknowledgment of role
- Historical basis for position

## Licence-Specific Indicators

### Public Licence Assessment

| Dimension | Strong Indicators | Weak Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Credibility | Clean regulatory record, proactive disclosure | Enforcement actions, disputed compliance |
| Consistency | Predictable regulatory engagement | Selective compliance, jurisdiction shopping |
| Validity | All required approvals current | Pending applications, conditional permits |

**Quantitative proxies:**
- Number of regulatory breaches (trailing 3 years)
- Time to resolve compliance issues
- Audit outcomes and ratings
- Permit approval rates

### Social Licence Assessment

| Dimension | Strong Indicators | Weak Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Credibility | Community advocates for organisation | Active community opposition |
| Consistency | Reliable neighbour, predictable impacts | Broken local commitments, surprise announcements |
| Validity | Genuine community benefit, local presence | Extractive relationship, absentee ownership |

**Quantitative proxies:**
- Community sentiment surveys
- Local employment and procurement rates
- Grievance/complaint volumes and resolution rates
- Community benefit agreement compliance
- Employee engagement scores
- Customer NPS by segment

### Popular Licence Assessment

| Dimension | Strong Indicators | Weak Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Credibility | Positive media coverage, trusted brand | Negative press, viral criticism |
| Consistency | Values-aligned public behaviour | Public contradictions, "hypocrisy" narratives |
| Validity | Cultural fit, accepted presence | Perceived as outsider, unwelcome, or harmful |

**Quantitative proxies:**
- Brand tracking studies
- Social media sentiment analysis
- Share of voice (positive/negative/neutral)
- Unprompted awareness and associations

## Quantitative Measurement Approaches

While societal capital is fundamentally qualitative, quantitative indicators can inform assessment:

### Composite Indices

Create weighted scores across indicators:
- Assign weights based on materiality to the organisation
- Track movement over time rather than absolute scores
- Compare across peer group for benchmarking

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

**Leading indicators** (predictive):
- Employee sentiment trends
- Social media conversation shifts
- Regulatory inquiry volumes
- Community meeting attendance/tone

**Lagging indicators** (confirmatory):
- Enforcement actions
- Customer churn
- Protest events
- Media crisis incidents

### Threshold Analysis

Identify critical thresholds where licence status changes:
- What level of community opposition triggers project delay?
- What sentiment score correlates with boycott risk?
- What regulatory breach count triggers licence review?

## Leadership as a Factor

Leadership visibility and credibility directly impact societal capital:

### CEO and Board Accountability

- Societal capital reflects cumulative organisational behaviour
- Cannot be delegated to functional teams
- Board-level oversight signals seriousness
- CEO communications set tone

### Leadership Credibility Indicators

- Public trust in leadership (vs organisation)
- Leadership response to crises
- Accessibility and engagement with stakeholders
- Personal behaviour alignment with organisational values

### Assessment Questions

1. Is leadership visible on societal capital issues?
2. Do leaders have credibility with key stakeholder groups?
3. Is there alignment between leadership statements and organisational behaviour?
4. How has leadership responded to past challenges?

### Warning Signs

- Leadership disconnected from stakeholder concerns
- "Tone at the top" contradicts stated values
- Crisis response that protects leaders over organisation
- Revolving door leadership during societal capital challenges
