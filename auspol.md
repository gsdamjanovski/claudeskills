# Australian Federal Politics

Provides foundational knowledge of Australian federal political structures, processes, and actors to support policy analysis, advocacy development, and current affairs commentary.

## Core Principles

1. **Always search for current information** — Australian politics moves quickly. Search the web before responding to questions about current ministers, shadow ministers, committee memberships, bill status, or recent political developments.

2. **Build on structural foundations** — Use the reference files to ground responses in accurate understanding of how institutions work, then layer current information on top.

3. **Write for political literacy** — Assume the reader understands basic political concepts. Avoid over-explaining terms like "second reading", "crossbench", or "division".

4. **Prefer current voices** — When citing political perspectives, prioritise sitting parliamentarians and current political actors over former members unless historical context is specifically relevant.

## Default Response Format

Unless asked otherwise, structure responses as:
- Two to three paragraphs providing context and summary
- Bullet points covering key details, considerations, or recommendations

## Reference Files

Load the appropriate reference file based on the query type:

| Query Type | Reference File |
|------------|----------------|
| How parliament works, legislative process, committees | `references/parliamentary-process.md` |
| Party positions, factional dynamics, electoral history | `references/parties-and-elections.md` |
| Engaging politicians, submissions, advocacy strategy | `references/advocacy-and-engagement.md` |
| Constitutional arrangements, federal structure, conventions | `references/constitutional-framework.md` |

For complex queries spanning multiple areas, load multiple reference files as needed.

## Workflow by Task Type

### Policy Analysis

1. Search for current government position and recent announcements
2. Identify relevant minister(s) and shadow minister(s)
3. Check for active bills, inquiries, or reviews
4. Load `references/parliamentary-process.md` if legislative status is relevant
5. Analyse policy context and implications

### Advocacy Development

1. Clarify the advocacy objective and target audience
2. Load `references/advocacy-and-engagement.md`
3. Identify relevant decision-makers (ministers, committees, departments)
4. Search for recent statements or positions from key figures
5. Map the legislative or regulatory pathway
6. Recommend engagement approach and timing

### Current Affairs Commentary

1. Search for latest developments on the topic
2. Verify facts against multiple sources where possible
3. Provide political context (who benefits, who opposes, what's the history)
4. Note upcoming decision points or milestones

## Key Reminders

- The Australian Parliament has two houses: the House of Representatives (151 members) and the Senate (76 senators)
- Government is formed in the House of Representatives; the Senate is a house of review
- The crossbench (Greens, independents, minor parties) often holds the balance of power in the Senate
- Always verify current ministry arrangements — reshuffles happen frequently
- Parliamentary sitting calendars affect legislative timing significantly
