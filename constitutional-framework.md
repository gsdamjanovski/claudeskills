## Constitutional Structure

### The Crown and Governor-General

- Australia is a constitutional monarchy; King is head of state
- Governor-General is the King's representative; exercises powers on ministerial advice
- Reserve powers exist but rarely used (1975 dismissal being the exception)
- Practical power rests with elected government

### The Executive

- **Cabinet**: Senior ministers; collective decision-making; bound by cabinet solidarity
- **Ministry**: All ministers including outer ministry and assistant ministers
- **Executive Council**: Formal body that advises Governor-General; approves regulations
- **Prime Minister**: First among equals; chairs cabinet; advises on ministry appointments

### The Parliament

- Bicameral: House of Representatives (151 members) and Senate (76 senators)
- Parliament's functions: legislation, representation, scrutiny of executive
- Sovereignty of parliament limited by Constitution and High Court interpretation

### The Judiciary

- High Court: Final appellate court; interprets Constitution
- Federal Court, Family Court, Federal Circuit Court handle federal matters
- Separation of judicial power from executive (Chapter III of Constitution)
- High Court appointments by Governor-General on PM advice; no Senate confirmation

## Division of Powers

### Commonwealth (Federal) Powers

**Exclusive powers** (only Commonwealth can legislate):
- Customs and excise duties
- Defence and naval/military forces  
- Currency and coinage
- External affairs and treaties
- Immigration and emigration

**Concurrent powers** (both levels can legislate; Commonwealth prevails if inconsistent):
- Taxation (except customs/excise)
- Banking and insurance
- Corporations
- Trade and commerce
- Communications
- Social services

### State Powers

- Residual powers: anything not granted to Commonwealth remains with states
- Key state responsibilities: health, education, police, land use, transport
- States have their own constitutions, parliaments, and courts

### Tied Grants and Fiscal Federalism

- Commonwealth raises most revenue (especially income tax, GST)
- GST distributed to states; Commonwealth attaches conditions to other grants
- Vertical fiscal imbalance: states depend on Commonwealth funding
- National agreements (e.g., health, education) govern major funding arrangements

### Intergovernmental Relations

- **National Cabinet**: PM and state/territory premiers; coordinates policy
- **Ministerial councils**: Portfolio-specific coordination
- **COAG** (Council of Australian Governments): Predecessor to National Cabinet
- Cooperative federalism: Many policy areas require Commonwealth-state collaboration

## Constitutional Conventions

### Responsible Government

- Government must maintain confidence of House of Representatives
- Ministers accountable to parliament; must answer questions
- Loss of confidence motion or supply requires government to resign or seek election
- Not written in Constitution but fundamental to system

### Cabinet Government

- Collective ministerial responsibility: cabinet decisions binding on all ministers
- Cabinet confidentiality: deliberations not disclosed
- Individual ministerial responsibility: ministers accountable for their portfolio
- Ministerial code of conduct supplements conventions

### Caretaker Conventions

- Apply from election announcement until result clear
- Government avoids major decisions, appointments, contracts
- Departments do not brief opposition without caretaker PM approval
- Conventions, not law — enforceable by political pressure only

### Reserve Powers

- Governor-General's powers exercisable without or against ministerial advice
- Include: dismissing PM, refusing dissolution, refusing assent
- Used extremely rarely; 1975 dismissal remains deeply contested
- Existence acknowledged but scope debated

## Constitutional Change

### Referendum Requirements (s.128)

- Bill must pass both houses (or one house twice with interval)
- Referendum requires double majority:
  - Majority of voters nationally, AND
  - Majority of voters in majority of states (4 of 6)
- Very high bar: only 8 of 44 referendums have passed

### Successful Referendums

Examples of what has passed:
- 1967: Aboriginal people counted in census; Commonwealth given race power
- 1977: Senate casual vacancies; territory referendum rights; retirement age for judges
- Most recent: 1977

### Failed Referendums

Common failure patterns:
- Lack of bipartisan support
- Perceived as benefiting Commonwealth over states
- Insufficient public understanding or engagement
- "If in doubt, vote no" tendency

### Alternative Paths to Change

- High Court interpretation evolves constitutional meaning over time
- Commonwealth-state agreements can achieve practical reform
- Referral of powers (states refer power to Commonwealth under s.51(xxxvii))
- Political and administrative change within existing framework

### Indigenous Constitutional Recognition

- Multiple proposals over recent decades
- 2023 Voice referendum defeated
- Debate continues over form recognition should take
- Search for current status of any proposals
