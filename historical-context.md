## The Four Eras of Public Permission

Societies have granted permission to organisations in different ways across history. Understanding these eras helps contextualise current expectations.

### Era 1: Exploitation (pre-1900s)

Organisations operated with minimal accountability. Permission was largely assumed through economic power or state sponsorship. Community and public concerns were rarely considered unless they threatened order.

**Characteristics:**
- Profit as sole organising principle
- Labour and environmental exploitation normalised
- Limited regulatory oversight
- Public voice largely absent

### Era 2: Compliance (early-mid 20th century)

The rise of the regulatory state. Governments began codifying minimum standards for organisational behaviour. Permission became increasingly tied to meeting legal requirements.

**Characteristics:**
- Emergence of labour laws, environmental regulations, consumer protection
- Compliance as risk management
- "Licence to operate" became literal (permits, approvals)
- Reactive relationship with regulators

### Era 3: Adherence (late 20th century)

Beyond compliance to voluntary standards. Organisations began adopting industry codes, sustainability frameworks, and corporate responsibility initiatives. Permission increasingly tied to demonstrating good faith.

**Characteristics:**
- Self-regulation and industry codes
- CSR reporting, sustainability commitments
- Stakeholder engagement as practice
- Proactive relationship management

### Era 4: Consent (current)

The digital age has fundamentally changed the permission landscape. Stakeholders expect ongoing consent, not one-time approval. Permission must be continuously earned and can be revoked rapidly.

**Characteristics:**
- Transparency as baseline expectation
- Real-time accountability via social media
- Values alignment matters (not just behaviour)
- Informal permission (popular licence) as powerful as formal

## The Emergence of Social Consent

Several technological and social shifts created the current consent-based environment:

### Digital Democratisation of Scrutiny

**Social media** gives individuals and communities unprecedented ability to organise, amplify concerns, and hold organisations accountable. A local issue can become global news within hours.

**Smartphones** mean every employee, customer, and community member is a potential witness and broadcaster. Internal practices are no longer internal.

**Algorithmic platforms** amplify emotionally resonant content, often negative. Crises spread faster than corrections.

### Shifted Power Dynamics

**Information asymmetry has collapsed.** Organisations can no longer control narratives through traditional media gatekeepers. Stakeholders access information directly and form independent judgments.

**Collective action costs have dropped.** Organising boycotts, campaigns, or protests requires minimal resources. "Cancel culture" reflects the low friction of withdrawing popular licence.

**Employees as stakeholders.** Workforce expectations have expanded beyond compensation to include purpose, values, and social impact. Internal social licence matters.

### Implications

- **Speed**: Licence can be lost in days or hours, not months or years
- **Scope**: Local issues become global; niche concerns go mainstream
- **Permanence**: Digital memory means past behaviour remains accessible
- **Authenticity**: Performative gestures are quickly identified and penalised

## Why This Matters Now

### The Consent Era is Unforgiving

Organisations operating on compliance-era assumptions face existential risk. Meeting legal requirements is necessary but insufficient. Community acceptance and public tolerance must be actively cultivated.

### Societal Capital is Strategic

In the consent era, societal capital functions like financial capital:
- It can be built through investment (in relationships, transparency, values-aligned behaviour)
- It can be depleted through withdrawal (broken promises, scandals, inconsistency)
- It generates returns (resilience, advocacy, benefit of the doubt)
- Its absence creates costs (opposition, scrutiny, restricted access)

### Leadership Responsibility

Societal capital cannot be delegated to communications, ESG, or stakeholder relations functions. It reflects the sum of organisational behaviour and must be owned at CEO and board level. Every decision either builds or depletes this capital.
