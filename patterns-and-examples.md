## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### The Compliance Trap

**Pattern:** Strong public licence, weak social and popular licences.

An organisation meets all regulatory requirements but lacks community acceptance or public trust. Common in industries with strong regulatory frameworks but poor reputations.

**Historical examples:**
- Tobacco companies maintained legal compliance while losing popular licence
- Payday lenders operating within regulations but facing sustained public opposition
- Compliant chemical facilities opposed by local communities

**Vulnerability:** Regulatory change driven by public pressure; community resistance to expansion; talent attraction difficulties.

### The Disruptor Gap

**Pattern:** Strong social and popular licences, weak public licence.

Often seen in technology companies and innovative startups that gain user love and public enthusiasm but operate in regulatory grey zones.

**Historical examples:**
- Ride-sharing platforms initially operating without taxi licences
- Cryptocurrency exchanges before regulatory clarity
- Short-term rental platforms in unregulated markets

**Vulnerability:** Enforcement action; regulatory crackdown; legitimacy questions undermine other licences.

**Note:** This configuration is inherently unstable. It typically resolves through either regulatory accommodation (gaining public licence) or enforcement (losing operating ability).

### The Ivory Tower

**Pattern:** Strong public and popular licences, weak social licence.

Organisations that are legally compliant and publicly respected but lack acceptance from directly affected communities. Common with large institutions perceived as distant or extractive.

**Historical examples:**
- Universities with poor town-gown relations
- Hospitals opposed by neighbouring residents
- Mining companies with government support but community opposition

**Vulnerability:** Project delays; local resistance; employee/supplier relations damage.

### The Paper Tiger

**Pattern:** Strong public licence only.

Organisations operating on regulatory permission alone, without community support or public goodwill. Often seen in declining industries or those with captured regulators.

**Historical examples:**
- Late-stage fossil fuel projects with permits but opposition
- Licensed gambling operations facing community backlash
- Monopolies with regulatory protection but customer resentment

**Vulnerability:** Regulatory change; accelerated decline; inability to adapt.

## Asymmetric Licence Configurations

Any configuration where licence strength varies significantly across the three types is inherently unstable. The asymmetry creates pressure:

### Resolution Pathways

Asymmetric configurations typically resolve in one of two directions:

**Upward resolution:** The organisation gains the missing licence(s)
- Requires genuine engagement and behaviour change
- Takes time and sustained effort
- Success validates the organisation's position

**Downward resolution:** The organisation loses existing licence(s)
- Weak licences contaminate strong ones
- Opposition in one domain spreads to others
- Cascade failure possible

### Stability Assessment

When analysing asymmetric positions, assess:
1. **Direction of pressure** — Is the gap closing or widening?
2. **Active opposition** — Are stakeholders in weak-licence areas mobilising?
3. **Contagion risk** — Could weakness spread to strong-licence areas?
4. **Intervention capacity** — Can the organisation credibly address gaps?

## Trajectory Patterns

### Building Pattern

**Characteristics:**
- Proactive stakeholder engagement
- Transparency increasing over time
- Promises kept, trust earned
- Positive feedback loops emerging

**Indicators:**
- Stakeholder advocacy (not just acceptance)
- Benefit of the doubt in ambiguous situations
- Invitation to policy discussions
- Employee pride, talent attraction

### Erosion Pattern

**Characteristics:**
- Reactive crisis management
- Stakeholder relationships transactional
- Small breaches accumulating
- Negative sentiment baseline rising

**Indicators:**
- Increased scrutiny of routine activities
- Loss of benefit of the doubt
- Regulatory inquiry frequency
- Difficulty recruiting, retention issues

### Crisis Pattern

**Characteristics:**
- Acute event triggers rapid licence loss
- Multiple stakeholder groups mobilise
- Media amplification
- Organisation in defensive posture

**Indicators:**
- Active boycott/divestment campaigns
- Regulatory investigation launched
- Leadership credibility collapsed
- Existential questions raised

### Recovery Pattern

**Characteristics:**
- Post-crisis rebuilding
- Genuine accountability demonstrated
- New leadership or governance
- Stakeholder re-engagement

**Indicators:**
- Stabilised sentiment (floor reached)
- Stakeholder willingness to engage
- Reduced media intensity
- Internal rebuild underway

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Extractive Industries (Mining, Oil & Gas)

- Public licence often leads, but insufficient alone
- Social licence critical due to direct community impacts
- Popular licence increasingly challenging (climate, environment)
- Geographic variation extreme (jurisdictional differences)

### Financial Services

- Public licence highly developed (prudential regulation)
- Social licence varies by segment (retail vs institutional)
- Popular licence volatile (crisis memory, inequality narratives)
- Trust recovery after crisis takes decades

### Technology

- Public licence often lags (regulatory catch-up)
- Social licence can be strong (user affinity) but also weak (worker conditions)
- Popular licence bifurcated (innovation enthusiasm vs big tech backlash)
- Cohort differences pronounced (generational, geographic)

### Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals

- Public licence strong (safety regulation)
- Social licence varies (patient trust vs payer tensions)
- Popular licence vulnerable (pricing, access narratives)
- COVID era reshaped expectations

### Consumer Goods and Retail

- Public licence baseline (product safety, labour law)
- Social licence through supply chain (ethical sourcing)
- Popular licence brand-driven (reputation, values alignment)
- Consumer cohort segmentation critical

### Energy and Utilities

- Public licence dominant (regulated monopolies)
- Social licence local (infrastructure siting)
- Popular licence transitioning (decarbonisation pressure)
- Incumbent vs new entrant dynamics differ

## Using Examples in Analysis

When identifying vulnerability patterns in an organisation, reference historical examples to:

1. **Illustrate the pattern** — Show that this configuration has occurred before
2. **Indicate likely trajectory** — Suggest how similar situations have resolved
3. **Identify warning signs** — Note what preceded crisis in analogous cases
4. **Suggest intervention points** — Highlight where others succeeded or failed in course correction

Select examples from different industries to demonstrate pattern generality rather than industry-specific factors.
