## Legislative Process

### How a Bill Becomes Law

1. **First Reading** — Bill introduced, title read, no debate
2. **Second Reading** — Minister explains purpose; main policy debate occurs; vote on principle
3. **Consideration in Detail** (House) / **Committee of the Whole** (Senate) — Clause-by-clause examination; amendments moved
4. **Third Reading** — Final vote on the bill as amended; usually formal
5. **Passage to Other House** — Process repeats; any amendments must be agreed by originating house
6. **Royal Assent** — Governor-General signs; bill becomes an Act

### Money Bills

- Must originate in the House of Representatives
- Senate cannot amend (only request amendments) but can block
- Defined under s.53 of the Constitution

### Government vs Private Members' Bills

- **Government bills**: Introduced by ministers; dominate the legislative agenda; have departmental and parliamentary counsel support
- **Private members' bills**: Introduced by backbenchers or crossbenchers; rarely pass without government support; useful for agenda-setting and public debate

### Disallowance of Delegated Legislation

- Regulations and legislative instruments can be disallowed by either house within 15 sitting days
- Senate disallowance motions are a key accountability mechanism
- Crossbench senators frequently use this power

## Committee System

### Types of Committees

**Standing Committees**
- Permanent; established by standing orders
- Include legislation committees and references committees (Senate)
- Examples: Senate Economics Legislation Committee, Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security

**Select Committees**
- Temporary; established for specific inquiries
- Dissolved once final report tabled

**Joint Committees**
- Members from both houses
- Often oversight functions (e.g., PJCIS, Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services)

### Senate Legislation vs References Committees

- **Legislation Committees**: Government majority; examine bills referred to them
- **References Committees**: Non-government majority; conduct broader inquiries on matters referred by the Senate

### Making Submissions

- Submissions are public unless confidentiality requested
- Committees publish submissions on APH website
- Appearing at hearings: witnesses can be summoned; parliamentary privilege applies

### Key Oversight Committees

- Senate Estimates (scrutinises expenditure and administration)
- Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit
- Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (reviews national security legislation)

## Senate Powers and Procedures

### Balance of Power

- 76 senators: 12 per state, 2 per territory
- Government rarely holds a Senate majority
- Crossbench negotiations essential for passing legislation

### Senate Procedural Tools

- **Urgency motions**: Debate matters of public importance
- **Orders for Production of Documents**: Compel government to release documents
- **References to committees**: Any senator can move to refer a matter
- **Disallowance motions**: Block delegated legislation

### Resolving Disagreements Between Houses

1. Messages exchanged proposing/rejecting amendments
2. If deadlock persists after three months, triggers for double dissolution may exist
3. Joint sitting after double dissolution (rare; last was 1974)
