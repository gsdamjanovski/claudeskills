name: societal-capital
description: Analytical framework for assessing organisational permission to operate through the intersection of public, social, and popular licences. Use this skill when asked about societal capital, social licence (noting this is a common misnomer for the broader concept), public licence to operate, community acceptance, stakeholder legitimacy, or when analysing how organisations maintain or lose permission to operate across regulatory, community, and public dimensions. Also use when assessing reputational risk, stakeholder relations, or the sustainability of an organisation's position in society.

# Societal Capital

An analytical lens for understanding how organisations earn, maintain, and lose permission to operate in society. Societal capital emerges at the intersection of three distinct licence types, each granted by different stakeholders with different expectations.

## Core Framework

### The Three Licences

**Public Licence** — Formal permission from institutions
- Regulatory approvals, legal compliance, government endorsements
- Granted by: legislatures, regulators, courts, government bodies
- Characteristics: codified, enforceable, often binary (compliant/non-compliant)
- Examples: operating licences, planning approvals, professional accreditations

**Social Licence** — Acceptance from directly affected communities
- Trust and consent from stakeholders with direct exposure to an organisation's operations
- Granted by: local communities, employees, suppliers, customers, industry peers
- Characteristics: earned through relationship, often informal, requires ongoing maintenance
- Examples: community support for a mine, employee trust in leadership, customer loyalty

**Popular Licence** — Tolerance from broader society
- General public perception and cultural acceptance
- Granted by: general public, media, cultural commentators, social movements
- Characteristics: diffuse, volatile, shaped by narrative and perception, easily revoked
- Examples: brand reputation, public sentiment toward an industry, cultural acceptability

### The Venn Diagram Model

Societal capital exists at the intersection of all three licences. Organisations can occupy various positions:

| Position | Description | Stability |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Full societal capital** | All three licences held | Most stable, but requires ongoing work |
| **Public + Social only** | Compliant and community-accepted, but public backlash | Vulnerable to campaigns, media scrutiny |
| **Public + Popular only** | Compliant and publicly liked, but community opposition | Vulnerable to local resistance, NIMBYism |
| **Social + Popular only** | Community and public support, but regulatory gaps | Vulnerable to enforcement, legitimacy questions |
| **Single licence only** | Only one form of permission | Highly unstable, unsustainable long-term |
| **No licences** | Operating without permission | Crisis state, existential risk |

When an organisation has asymmetric licence positions (strong in some, weak in others), flag this as an inherently unstable configuration that typically resolves through either gaining the missing licences or losing the existing ones.

## Analytical Approach

### Assessing Current State

For each licence type, evaluate:

1. **Credibility** — Is the organisation believed? Does it have a track record of delivering on commitments?
2. **Consistency** — Does behaviour match stated values? Are actions predictable and principled?
3. **Validity** — Is the organisation's position legitimate? Does it have the right to operate in this space?

### Identifying Trajectory

Beyond current state, assess whether societal capital appears to be:
- **Building** — trust increasing, relationships strengthening, perception improving
- **Stable** — maintained through ongoing effort, no significant movement
- **Eroding** — warning signs present, relationships fraying, sentiment shifting
- **In crisis** — active loss of one or more licences, urgent intervention required

### Cohort and Geographic Variation

Societal capital is not monolithic. Assess across:

**Geographic markets**
- An organisation may have strong societal capital in one country but weak in another
- Regulatory environments, cultural expectations, and historical context vary

**Stakeholder cohorts**
- Loyal customers vs light consumers vs non-customers
- Employees vs contractors vs suppliers
- Urban vs regional communities
- Different demographic or political segments

### Validated vs Unvalidated Perceptions

When assessing popular licence, distinguish between:
- **Validated perceptions** — beliefs supported by evidence, track record, or demonstrated behaviour
- **Unvalidated perceptions** — beliefs driven by narrative, media coverage, or association without factual basis

Both matter for societal capital (perception is reality in popular licence), but the distinction informs strategy. Unvalidated negative perceptions may be addressed through communication; validated negative perceptions require behavioural change.

## Output Guidelines

### Analysis Format

Stick to analysis unless explicitly asked for strategic recommendations. Structure assessments as:

1. **Current licence positions** — status of each licence type with supporting evidence
2. **Venn diagram position** — which zone the organisation occupies
3. **Trajectory** — whether capital is building, stable, or eroding
4. **Vulnerabilities** — asymmetries, gaps, or warning signs
5. **Cohort/geographic variation** — where relevant

When identifying vulnerability patterns (e.g., strong public licence but weak popular licence), offer brief historical examples from other organisations or industries that faced similar configurations.

### Hypothetical Scenarios

When asked "What if X did Y?", assess both:
- **Short-term impacts** — immediate effects on each licence type
- **Long-term impacts** — how the situation might evolve, potential for recovery or escalation

### Visual Output

When analysis would benefit from visualisation, offer to create a Venn diagram showing the organisation's position across the three licence types. This is particularly useful when:
- Comparing multiple organisations
- Showing movement over time
- Illustrating asymmetric positions

## Terminology Note

If a user asks about "social licence" when they appear to mean the broader concept of societal capital, explain the distinction once per conversation: social licence specifically refers to acceptance from directly affected communities, while societal capital encompasses the intersection of public, social, and popular licences. Then proceed with the full framework.

## Attribution

This framework draws on the Societal Capital model developed by General Strategic Group. Reference the source white paper only once per conversation, if attribution would be helpful to the user.

## Reference Files

Load the appropriate reference file based on query type:

| Query Type | Reference File |
|------------|----------------|
| Historical context, four eras of public permission | `references/historical-context.md` |
| Assessment criteria, measurement approaches | `references/assessment-criteria.md` |
| Common patterns, case examples, vulnerability types | `references/patterns-and-examples.md` |

For complex queries spanning multiple areas, load multiple reference files as needed.
